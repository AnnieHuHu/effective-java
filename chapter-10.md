# Chapter 10: Concurrency

## Item 66: Synchronize access to shared mutable data

When multiple threads share mutable data, each thread that reads or writes the data must perform synchronization. Without synchronization, there is no guarantee that one threadâ€™s changes will be visible to another. The penalties for failing to synchronize shared mutable data are liveness and safety failures. These failures are among the most difficult to debug. They can be intermittent and timing-dependent, and program behavior can vary radically from one VM to another. If you need only inter-thread communication, and not mutual exclusion, the volatile modifier is an acceptable form of synchronization, but it can be tricky to use correctly.

## Item 67: Avoid excessive synchronization

To avoid deadlock and data corruption, never call an alien method from within a synchronized region. More generally, try to limit the amount of work that you do from within synchronized regions. When you are designing a mutable class, think about whether it should do its own synchronization. In the modern multicore era, it is more important than ever not to synchronize excessively. Synchronize your class internally only if there is a good reason to do so, and document your decision clearly (Item 70).

## Item 68: Prefer executors and tasks to threads

You should generally use Executor Framework, which is a flexible interface-based task execution facility.
