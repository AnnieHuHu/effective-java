# Chapter 7: Methods

## Item 38: Check parameters for validity

Each time you write a method or constructor, you should think about what restrictions exist on its parameters. You should document these restric- tions and enforce them with explicit checks at the beginning of the method body. It is important to get into the habit of doing this. The modest work that it entails will be paid back with interest the first time a validity check fails.

## Item 39: Make defensive copies when needed

If a class has mutable components that it gets from or returns to its clients, the class must defensively copy these components. If the cost of the copy would be prohibitive and the class trusts its clients not to modify the compo- nents inappropriately, then the defensive copy may be replaced by documentation outlining the clientâ€™s responsibility not to modify the affected components.
